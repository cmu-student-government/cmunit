    <h2>CMUnits</h2>

    <p>
        The CMUnits extension inserts average hours spent data from Faculty Course Evaluations (FCEs)
        into the schedule planning process for Carnegie Mellon University students.
        This information is collected from students like you at the end of each semester when
        you fill out FCEs and report how much time you spent on a course during an average week.
        This data is best used as a guide rather than an exact estimate.
    </p>

    <h3>How It Works</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Data is shown from the last semester the course was taught.</li>
        <li>The current version does not take instructor into account, so if a course is taught by multiple instructors, an average is taken across lecturers.</li>
        <li>No data is presented for a course if it is a new course, no data exists, or there were less than five responses the last time it was taught.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Privacy</h3>
    <p>
        We do not store any data. You may view the source code here: <a target='_newtab' href="https://github.com/cmu-student-government/cmunit/tree/master/src">https://github.com/cmu-student-government/cmunit/tree/master/src</a>

    <p>
        This is the first version of the extension so we want to hear your
